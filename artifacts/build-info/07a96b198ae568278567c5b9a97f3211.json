@dev Implementation of the {IERC165} interface.\n Contracts that want to implement ERC-165 should inherit from this contract and override {supportsInterface} to check\n for the additional interface id that will be supported. For example:\n ```solidity\n function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId) public view virtual override returns (bool) {\n     return interfaceId == type(MyInterface).interfaceId || super.supportsInterface(interfaceId);\n }\n
